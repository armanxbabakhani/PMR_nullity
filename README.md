# PMR_nullity

In this project, an output file of a Hamiltonian is generated from an input file of an unrotated Hamiltonian and that of a Unitary transformation.
The format of the input file is as follows

$$c_{1} n_{11} p_{11} n_{12} p_{12} \ldots n_{1k} p_{1k} \\
c_{2} n_{21} p_{21} n_{22} p_{22} \ldots n_{2k} p_{2k} \\
\vdots
c_m n_m1 p_m1 n_m2 p_m2 \ldots n_{mk} p_{mk}$$
