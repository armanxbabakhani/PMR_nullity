# PMR_nullity

In this project, an output file of a Hamiltonian is generated from an input file of an unrotated Hamiltonian and that of a Unitary transformation.
The format of the input file is as follows

c_1 n_11 p_11 n_12 p_12 ... n_1k p_1k
c_2 n_21 p_21 n_22 p_22 ... n_2k p_2k
.

c_m n_m1 p_m1 n_m2 p_m2 ... n_mk p_mk
