# PMR_nullity

In this project, an output file of a Hamiltonian is generated from an input file of an unrotated Hamiltonian and that of a Unitary transformation.
The format of the input file is as follows

```math
\displaylines{c_{1} \, n_{11} p_{11} n_{12} p_{12} \ldots n_{1k} p_{1k} \\\ c_{2} \, n_{21} p_{21} n_{22} p_{22} \ldots n_{2k} p_{2k} \\\ \vdots \\\ c_m \, n_{m1} p_{m1} n_{m2} p_{m2} \ldots n_{mk} p_{mk} } 
```

So, using this format of input and output for an input Hamiltonian and a Unitary transformation, we create another file of the same format.
